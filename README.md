# Making Money from Breasonings

* Write breasonings. After studying a Nietzsche Philosophy subject, a creative writing subject and an education subject, write down practical (general) philosophies and computer ideas. I used these ideas to become a film and television extra.
* I became a film and television extra by applying to an agent while studying a theatre short course. I found writing and professionally producing pop songs helped with this.
* Teach meditation. Meditation helped me meet the professional requirements of show business, prevent headaches, support writing and become immortal.
* Teach how to become immortal. See <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Time_Machine">Time Machine</a>. This unbelievable skill helps prevent medical problems and accidents.
* Teach how to use or use Text to Breasonings <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text to Breasonings</a>. Learn to use this software to help earn high distinctions, support but not conceive healthy children, earn jobs, sell products, produce quantum energy, read minds, display spiritual screens, time travel, replicate or become immortal by studying education and music and writing a pedagogical (breasonings) recordings argument.
* Teach philosophy. Teach and assess paying students your philosophy online. This job may require studying business, setting up a website with your texts and quizzes and a PayPal or other payment button. You can apply to become an accredited Continuing Professional Development provider. Pedagogy helps attract customers by meeting professional requirements, breasons out high distinctions and with studying business to help with starting a business.
